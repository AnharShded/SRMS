SRMS - Java OOP

The Student Record Management System (SRMS) is a Java-based application designed to manage and organize student data using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. The system allows users to add, update, delete, and view student records. It supports both regular students and graduate students through inheritance, includes file handling using CSV format, and implements a background auto-save thread. In addition, the system provides multiple report features such as sorting students by GPA, finding top students, and calculating the average GPA. The project follows a modular structure using Java packages for better organization and maintainability.

Technologies Used:

1.Java SE 2.NetBeans IDE 3.CSV file for data storage 4.Multithreading (AutoSave Thread)

How to Run the Project?

1.Download or clone the project from GitHub. 2.Open the project in NetBeans. 3.Ensure the folder "data" exists inside the project directory. 4.Ensure the file "students.csv" is inside the "data" folder. 5.Run the Main.java file. 6.The system will automatically load the CSV file at startup and auto-save data in the background.

Conclusion:

This project demonstrates the application of Java OOP concepts including inheritance, encapsulation, modular design, file handling, and multithreading. The system provides a complete and functional student record management solution with persistent storage and real-time background saving, making it suitable for academic and practical use.
